We have updated the current version of xml, the maxi-xml.

We've review all of the old xml and added others, but our project is to replicate as many functions as possible as they are in the web version of Maxithlon, adding other xml too and considering your requests.

All XML's root is "maxi-xml". The feedback of the xml files, if there are errors, will be reported in the tag "error" (see example below). To use maxi-xml the basic link is "http://www.maxithlon.com/maxi-xml/" followed by the xml you want access. To download any xml you must login to the maxi-xml with username and security code. You can set your security code in Settings->Change Password.

Now to log in maxi-xml you'll must use something like this:
http://www.maxithlon.com/maxi-xml/login.php?user=XXX&scode=***

If it is correct the xml will be something similar to this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<maxi-xml>
<login>Login successful</login>
</maxi-xml>

Otherwise, if any error occurs, you can have an xml like the following:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<maxi-xml>
<error>Login failed</error>
</maxi-xml>


Following the list of the available xml.
